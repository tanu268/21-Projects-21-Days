🚀 Advanced Vision AI: Fast-Tracking Image Classification with Transfer Learning 🖼️

Day 9 – 21 Days, 21 Projects

In this project, we explored transfer learning for image classification. We first worked on the CIFAR-100 dataset and later prepared to train the same approach on the Oxford Flower dataset.

Key aspects of the project:
🔹 Leveraging pre-trained models like ResNet50, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 to accelerate training
🔹 Fine-tuning layers to improve model accuracy on new datasets
🔹 Efficient handling of image datasets for training and testing

Adapting the pre-trained models to our datasets was a bit tricky at first, but seeing the accuracy improve as layers were fine-tuned highlighted the power of transfer learning for real-world applications.

Grateful to our mentor @Harshvardhan Singh for guiding us and simplifying complex concepts. 🙌

🎨 Creative AI: Generating Art with Neural Style Transfer ✨

Day 10 – 21 Days, 21 Projects

In this project, we explored Neural Style Transfer to generate creative art by combining the content of one image with the style of another.

A highlight of the session was the concept of generator and discriminator explained through a great story, which made understanding Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) smooth and intuitive.

Key learnings:

 🔹 How a generator creates new images and the discriminator evaluates them

 🔹 Applying neural style transfer to blend content and style effectively

 🔹 Understanding the training dynamics of GANs in a simple, visual way

The storytelling approach made what usually feels abstract much easier to grasp, and seeing the generated art come to life was fascinating.

Grateful to our mentor @Harshvardhan Singh for making complex AI concepts approachable and fun. 🙌
